## Earthlings

Earthlings are a collection of 3,131 NFTs from NFTEarth, consisting of entirely unique NFTs, created using generative AI technology on the Arbitrum L2 network. Designed to be dynamic, they are all 100% unique in their creation having been minted using generative AI technology, and they evolve over time based on conditional relationships that either are met, or not met, which have an impact on the NFT.
