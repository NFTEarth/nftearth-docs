# üåè 100 Year Strategy

***

### Years 1-5**: The Foundation Phase - Digging Deep and Establishing Principles**

* Genesis Launch (Year 1): NFTEarth is born with a core team committed to Earth's well-being. The protocol launches as an open-source platform, focusing on easy NFT creation and interaction, ensuring accessibility for all.
* Protocols we admire and aspire to learn from and why.&#x20;

#### Protocol List:

* **Alchemix Fi**: The hands down best financial reporting in all of web3. Complete transparency delivered in quarterly reports to all stakeholders.&#x20;
* **Frax Finance**: Speed to market, financial reporting. Powerful use of visual analytics in Frax reporting.
* **Yearn Finance**: Innovators in not just DeFi, but DAO and decentralization maxis. Yearn embodies the the right blue pill.
* **Aave**: Dedication to onchain governance, formal verification.
* **GMX**: Leading with simplicity, tokenomic design, and a focus on scaling solutions to bring the masses to DeFi.
* **Balancer**: Dedication to opensource values, governance innovation such as veBAL.
* **Tarot**: Attention to detail, well designed smart contracts and focused protocol.
* **LiquidDriver**: Committed team that builds community and innovative DeFi solutions and pivots when necessary.
* **Yield Yak**: Excellent yield aggregation solidity contracts combined with a pleasant user interface.
* **Arbitrum**: A large foundation that is always open to hearing feedback from smaller players.
* **Chainlin**k: Without oracles, what is there to do?
* **Uniswap**: the DEX, enough said.
* **Angle**: Shipping consistently and innovating with solutions like Merkl for incentives.
* **Layer2DAO**: Dedication to remaining focused on the vision of enabling layer2 expansion, amidst competing demands for a focus on just 1 best solution.
* **RocketPool:** Decentralization maximalists helping secure the Ethereum network.

Of these 15 protocols mentioned, we can take this a bit further to distill down the values that they exhibit and clearly state what NFTEarth aims to bring to fruition in the space of non-fungible technology and the values we as a protocol hold in highest regard. 4 stand out, and this is what NFTEarth has come to represent as a protocol and DAO in its raison d'etre.

1. **Transparency** - in multiple facets. Transparent financial reporting, transparent vision for the DAO, user metrics and KPIs. Transparency is a fundamental premise of blockchain technology, it only serves as a net positive for the entire ecosystem when more protocols act in good faith over time.&#x20;
2. **Innovation**: What to these protocols do? They ship software that creates value in the realm of decentralized finance and digital sovereignty. They continue to find ways to innovate. Being committed to never resting on our laurels is a core value.
3. **Authenticity**: This is the toughest value of all because it can never be quantified. But all these protocols **care** about web3. They are here to make money, as all protocols are, but being a builder in web3 is more than just money, and these are the ones that are the real winners over-time. Commitment to building an onchain future is the most powerful thing we can all do as builders to positively impact society.
4. **Competitiveness**: Finding ways to win, many times when the odds are stacked against you. Competing fiercely, yet not maliciously. We believe there is a right way to win, and this indeed requires strategic, calculated moves to outcompete intelligent competitors, but never at the expense of your principles for being, and never in a way that cause harm to the ecosystem.&#x20;

* Elemental Evolution (Year 2): Four major updates, inspired by Earth's elements, to enhance the protocol's functionality through NFT solutions imbued with our values and unique product offerings in the non-fungible space:

_Earth_: Improving the foundational NFT technology for stability.

_Fire_: Enhancing smart contract security and efficiency.

_Water_: Introducing fluid NFT metadata standards to allow dynamic content.

_Air_: Developing decentralized storage solutions for NFT assets.
