The Earthenomics introduce a formalized path to the decentralization and autonomy of the NFTEarth Protocol. Covering governance mechanisms and financial incentives, it aims to share a vision of alignment between various stakeholders within the NFTEarth ecosystem, protocol functionality and the [NFTE](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nftearth) token as a core securing element of the NFTEarth Protocol.

> ### The goal of the NFTE Tokenomics, through its incentives and policies, is to create a Shelling Point where the growth of the protocol and safety are able to merge together seamlessly and take priority over individual stakeholder objectives.

This Earthenomics proposal is designed as a catalyst for the growth and long-term governance of the NFTEarth Protocol. The goal is to create a future-proof framework which relies on systemic incentives and multilevel governance to create an efficient equilibrium that stimulates long-term growth in addition to the optimization of the protocol.
