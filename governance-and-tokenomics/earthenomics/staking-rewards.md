# Staking Rewards

The NFTEarth Staking Rewards program is a multi-year incentive program that will distribute $NFTE tokens to stakeholders in the NFTEarth Protocol.

Staking and Farming serves to reward users who actively participate in the NFTEarth Protocol. A well-executed staking farming rewards program results in a fair distribution as well as governance over the NFTEarth Protocol, which is essential to its long-term success.
