This documentation covers all aspects of the NFTEarth Metaverse, including NFTEarth NFTs, Earthlings dFNT, EarthFi, Earth Domains, and the NFTEarth DAO. Please note, as the NFTEarth project evolves, so has the method to inform current and potential Earthlings. Like many projects, we began with a single, fixed roadmap, having now moved towards a flexible and dynamic archive of information that the NFTEarth team can update in response to new developments and progress.

You are welcome to read this entire documentation from start to finish, or jump around using the navigation panel to skip to a specific section you are most curious about.

Earthlings are a collection of 4,444 NFTs and  the flagship NFT project from NFTEarth, consisting of entirely unique NFTs, created using generative AI technology on the Arbitrum L2 network. Designed to be dynamic, they are all 100% unique in their creation having been minted using generative AI technology, and they evolve over time based on conditional relationships that either are met, or not met, which have an impact on the NFT. The NFT also will send revenue share, or "RevDrops" directly to holders via smart contract; keeping the close connection of aligning the economic interests of holders with long-term interests of the project.
