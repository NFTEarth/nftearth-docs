# ☎ Earth Domains

The Earth domain name service (EDNS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based and built around the Arbitrum Layer2 optimistic rollup.

EDNS is tasked with the job to mapping human-readable names like ‘Ed.Arbiter’ to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, and metadata. EDNS also supports ‘reverse resolution’, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.

EDNS has similar goals to DNS, which is something you are likely familiar with: the Internet’s Domain Name Service, but has significantly different architecture due to the capabilities and constraints provided by web3 and Arbitrum. Like DNS, EDNS operates on a system of dot-separated hierarchical names called domains, with the owner of a domain having full control over subdomains.

### How Does EDNS Work?

The primary engine that allows EDNS to work at scale are top-level domains - accessed through TLD Factory contracts.

**Example of a TLD: .arbiter**

**Example of a domain: scaling.arbiter**
