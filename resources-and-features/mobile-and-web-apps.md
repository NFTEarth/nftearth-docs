# ðŸ“± Mobile and Web Apps

The NFTEarth team is building a mobile application that will be native to both Android and iOS - in addition to the web application - built around the Arbitrum Layer2 optimistic rollup, all while inheriting the security of Ethereum.

The team is aiming to release both Android and iOS simultaneously, but may begin with Android, since there is a much larger global user base who have Android Operating Systems.

The ambition is unchanged with the rollout of the mobile application - to enable mass onboarding to web3 through meeting users where they are at, not the other way around, which is why we believe web3 protocols have failed to gain mass traction until now.



The team has been developing a mobile first strategy that centers on meeting the consumer where they currently are, contrary to what most web3 startups have focused on with the goal of acuiring new users. We're aware that most web3 applications, and NFT apps in particular, have struggled to gain traction by employing strategies common to the industry such as liquidity mining and clever tokenomic designs; thus the strategy for mobile first was born.

### PWAs, native mobile apps on Android and iOS, and the Web.&#x20;

We think that most people will appreciate the flexibility that comes with being able to use web3 when on their mobile device, at their desktop - or anywhere in between.&#x20;
