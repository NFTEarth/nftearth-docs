# ðŸ“± Mobile and Web Apps

The NFTEarth team is building a mobile application that will be native to both Android and iOS - in addition to the web application - built around the Arbitrum Layer2 optimistic rollup, all while inheriting the security of Ethereum.

The team is aiming to release both Android and iOS simultaneously, but may begin with Android, since there is a much larger global user base who have Android Operating Systems.

The ambition is unchanged with the rollout of the mobile application - to enable mass onboarding to web3 through meeting users where they are at, not the other way around, which is why we believe web3 protocols have failed to gain mass traction until now.



Check out some sneak peeks! We think that most people will appreciate the flexibility that comes with being able to use web3 when on their mobile device, at their desktop - or anywhere in between.
