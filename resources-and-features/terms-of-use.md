10.2 The limitations set forth in this Section 10 will not limit or exclude liability for the gross negligence, fraud or intentional misconduct of NFTEarth or the other NFTEarth Parties or for any other matters in which liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. Additionally, some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you.

* Release.
* 11.1 To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you release NFTEarth and the other NFTEarth Parties from responsibility, liability, claims, demands and/or damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown (including claims of negligence), arising out of or related to disputes between users and the acts or omissions of third parties. If you are a consumer who resides in California, you hereby waive your rights under California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”
* Changes to these Terms.
* 12.1 We may update, amend, alter, or modify these Terms in the future. You agree that NFTEarth may make changes to these Terms at any time and for any reason at its sole discretion. If we make material changes to these Terms, we will notify you and give you an opportunity to review the new Terms that will supersede and replace these Terms. Your continued access or use of the Services after notice of changes to these Terms will mean that you accept any and all of such changes. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop using the Services.
* Changes to the Services.
* 13.1 We may update, amend, alter, change, or stop the Services, from time to time without prior notice to you.

13.2 We doe not have any maintenance, update, or support obligations with respect to the Services. You agree that our updates to the Services may change the requirements necessary to use the Services, and you agree that in such an event you are responsible for any necessary actions, including but not limited to updating software or hardware to access and use the Services.

13.3 We are not responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to access or use the Services.

* Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration.
* 14.1 Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with NFTEarth and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.

14.2 No Representative Actions. You agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services is personal to you and NFTEarth and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.

14.3 Arbitration of Disputes. Except for disputes in which you or NFTEarth seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property, you and NFTEarth waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in court. Instead, for any Dispute that you have against NFTEarth you agree to first contact NFTEarth and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to NFTEarth by email at [team@layer2nfts.org](mailto:team@layer2nfts.org). The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and NFTEarth cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the Dispute to confidential, binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in the State of New York by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). You and NFTEarth agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 16 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, NFTEarth, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

14.4 You and NFTEarth agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee up to a maximum of $250, and NFTEarth will pay the remaining fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by NFTEarth, NFTEarth will pay all fees and costs. You and NFTEarth agree that the state or federal courts of the State of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.

14.5 Any dispute must be filed within one year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and NFTEarth will not have the right to assert the claim.

14.6 You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 14 by contacting NFTEarth at [team@layer2nfts.org](mailto:team@layer2nfts.org). In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 15.

14.7 If any portion of this Section 14 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 14 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 14; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 14 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 14 will be enforceable.

* Governing Law and Venue.
* 15.1 Any dispute arising from these Terms will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration will be resolved in the courts of the State of New York or federal courts located in the State of New York.
* Severability.
* 16.1 If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
* Feedback.
* 17.1 If you choose to provide input, ideas, suggestions, or feedback (“Feedback”) to us concerning the Services, then you hereby grant us an unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free right to exploit the Feedback in any manner and for any purpose, including to improve the Services and create other products and services.
* Miscellaneous.
* 18.1 These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and NFTEarth relating to the subject matter herein and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written.

18.2 Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.

18.3 The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.

18.4 Any provisions in these Terms that by their nature should survive termination of your access to the Services will survive (including, but not limited to, all limitations on liability, releases, and indemnification obligations).

18.5 You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights and obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may freely assign these Terms.

18.6 These Terms do not create any joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship between you and NFTEarth.

18.7 The provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive the termination of these Terms shall survive such termination.

18.8 Notices to you may be made via email or regular mail or, if applicable, by posting on the NFTEarth Website or the Services.

18.9 If you have any questions or concerns about these Terms, please email us at [team@layer2nfts.org](mailto:team@layer2nfts.org).
