# ðŸŽ¯ Strategy

## Why Arbitrum?

The NFTEarth token ($NFTE) is gradually making its home on the Arbitrum network, with plans to expand to other L2s. We chose Arbitrum for $NFTE for the following reasons:

* It has the highest number of wallets interacting.
* It has the highest TVL of all major L2 networks.
* It does not maintain a whitelist for projects to launch on its network.
* Safe supports Arbitrum, which is needed for the DAO treasury.
* Circle recently announced support for native $USDC on Arbitrum, which should solidify Arbitrum's dominant position in the Layer2 Optimistic rollup space.

We look forward to quickly expanding to other L2s. The order in which we expand will be based on the DAO community votes.
