# ðŸ’° Tokenomics

NFTEarth is a NFT finance liquidity protocol and marketplace. Its native governance token $NFTE provides multiple utilities and governance rights over the protocol by its holders. The protocol will be undergoing a significant upgrade in the decentralization of the protocol in the near future.&#x20;

The $NFTE token is hardcapped at 100M supply (100,000,000 tokens) and is live on Ethereum Mainnet (where the token was deployed), Optimism and Arbitrum, and Polygon zkEVM. Ethereum Mainnet was chosen for deployment due to providing the highest level of security possible for the token contract implementation.

The project has active collaborations with 4 Advisors and is seeking additional support from experienced senior leaders/teams in the web3 space, in addition to being selected as a web3 startup as part of the Google Cloud for Startups program and receiving an award of $200,000 in Cloud Credits from Google Cloud to built out the application infrastructure on GCP over the next 2 years.
