Link to NFTEarth Whitepaper: [Decentralized Liquidity and Exchange Protocol for NFT-Backed Lending](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TIKuQWgM7kGZr\_1GhqKffMyELc\_e8Ew-1xUY8pirhBo/edit?usp=sharing)\

The NFTEarth Whitepaper serves as a source of foundational direction for the protocol as of May, 2023, arrived at after significant trial and error, experimentation and testing, ultimately reaching the solution believed to offer the strongest PMF in the emerging space of NFTFinance and potential for practical application of combining Layer2 networks, DeFi, and NFTs - into NFTFi utility - and begin a wave of mass adoption of retail and institutional users to web3 due to enhanced **diversification** benefits enabled via ERC-4626 - the tokenized vault standard.\

Google (through their Google Cloud Platform for Startups) has granted NFTEarth $200,000 in Cloud Credits to be used in building out NFTEarth infrastructure on GCP over the next 2 years. This is a WIP as of early May, 2023, expecting completion by the end of the month, requiring formalized partnerships with additional existing DAOs, DeFi protocols, and other venture firms/private investors to fund development.&#x20;

Excerpt from the first page:

> &#x20;    Asset-backed lending is currently over a $1 trillion dollar market worldwide, and this allows for DeFi to begin tapping into this. The EarthFi protocol employs several unique key differentiators when compared with existing solutions that allow it to create efficiencies in an otherwise crowded Decentralized Finance/NFTFi ecosystem. Most notably, standardizing tokenized vaults allow for increased diversification, which enables all participants (lenders, borrowers, protocols, the EarthFi protocol, and other stakeholders) to manage risk more effectively â€“ this chief benefit; when combined with the lower costs of transactions on Layer2 networks and standardization of yield-bearing vaults, create an entirely new primitive in composability and an extension of decentralized finance.
