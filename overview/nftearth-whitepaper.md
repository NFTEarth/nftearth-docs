The NFTEarth Whitepaper serves as a source of foundational direction for the protocol as of May, 2023, arrived at after significant trial and error, experimentation and testing, ultimately reaching the solution we believe is the strongest PMF and potential for practical application of combining Layer2 networks, DeFi, and NFTs - into NFTFi - and begin a wave of mass adoption of retail and institutional users to web3 due to enhanced **diversification** benefits enabled via ERC-4626 - the tokenized vault standard.\

Google (through their Google Cloud Platform for Startups) has granted NFTEarth $200,000 in Cloud Credits to be used in building out NFTEarth infrastructure on GCP over the next 2 years. This is a WIP as of early May, 2023, expecting completion by the end of the month, requiring formalized partnerships with additional existing DAOs, DeFi protocols, and other venture firms/private investors to fund development.&#x20;

> &#x20;    NFTEarth is a decentralized liquidity protocol and marketplace for NFT-based lending and NFT trading. The introduction of standardization for yield-bearing assets, combined with Layer2 scaling solutions and non-fungible tokens create the potential for an enormous new DeFi market to be captured in the form of collateralized lending. The protocol employs several unique key differentiators when compared with existing solutions that allow it to create efficiencies in an otherwise crowded Decentralized Finance/NFTFi ecosystem. Most notably, tokenized vaults increase diversification, which enables all participants to manage risk more effectively â€“ this chief benefit; when combined with the lower cost of transaction on Layer2 networks and tokenized vaults, create a new primitive in composability and an extension of decentralized finance. The protocol leverages smart contracts, based on AAVEâ€™s lending mechanics to facilitate both secure and LTV health focused borrowing and lending. Lenders establish positions using baskets of tokenized vaults, based on ERC-4626, represented and receive a receipt in the form of an NFT for their deposit and borrowers use NFTs, tokenized from yield-bearing vaults, as collateral.
