The NFTEarth Whitepaper serves as a source of foundational direction for the protocol as of May, 2023, arrived at after significant trial and error, experimentation and testing, ultimately reaching the solution we believe is the strongest PMF and potential for practical application of combining Layer2 networks, DeFi, and NFTs - into NFTFi - and begin a wave of mass adoption of retail and institutional users to web3 due to enhanced **diversification** benefits enabled via ERC-4626 - the tokenized vault standard.\

Google (through their Google Cloud Platform for Startups) has granted NFTEarth $200,000 in Cloud Credits to be used in building out NFTEarth infrastructure on GCP over the next 2 years. This is a WIP as of early May, 2023, expecting completion by the end of the month, requiring formalized partnerships with additional existing DAOs, DeFi protocols, and other venture firms/private investors to fund development.&#x20;

> &#x20;    NFTEarth is a decentralized liquidity protocol and marketplace for NFT-based lending and NFT trading. The introduction of standardization for yield-bearing assets (via ERC-4626), combined with Layer2 scaling solutions such as Arbitrum and StarkNet create enormous new potentials for expanding decentralized finance markets. For additional user growth and adoption, not only standardized vaults and lower costs must be introduced, but also a significantly more seamless and user-friendly UX for the end users of protocols, whether individuals or institutions. Baskets of yield-bearing Vaults, represented as non-fungible tokens, enable this potential in the DeFi ecosystem to be captured largely in the form of collateralized lending. Asset-backed lending is currently over a $1 trillion dollar market worldwide, and this allows for DeFi to begin tapping into this
