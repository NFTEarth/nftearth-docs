# ðŸ¤‘ NFTE Liquidity

### This will create an opportunity for anyone who contributes to the protocol liquidity growth with the opportunity to earn rewards by staking the token that represents the LP asset. More details to come.&#x20;

* The liquidity pool on the L2 network Arbitrum is on [Balancer](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x161cd105034ac000d2aad75f06c26e943130bc0e000200000000000000000426) and you receive a token upon depositing liquidity. This token is what is used in the NFTEarth Staking Rewards Program.\

* Upon completion of your deposit, the token you received from adding liquidity to the NFTE/ WETH pool has the ticker identifier: **NFTFi On L2** and can be seen here on [Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/address/0x161cd105034ac000d2aad75f06c26e943130bc0e).
