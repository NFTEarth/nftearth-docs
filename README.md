## About NFTEarth

NFTEarth is a fun and playful NFT protocol that is focused on NFTFi and Layer2 Ethereum scaling networks. With a community built on mostly on Arbitrum and Optimism L2s, and a flagship NFT product Earthlings serving as a central piece of the NFTEarth Metaverse. The project began as a free mint NFT in December 2022, and from there has evolved into a lively and ambitious protocol aiming for bringing users from all over the Earth to web3. The team seeks to create web3 digital citizenship and a cultural movement with significant IP/brand potential and a vibrant community of artists, builders, and storytellers. NFTEarth was born to promote L2 adoption. The protocol was selected by Google Cloud for Startups Web3 as a project to receive exclusive support from Google Cloud; and granted $200,000 in Cloud Credits to build out NFTEarth on GCP Cloud infrastructure.



This documentation covers all aspects of the NFTEarth Metaverse, including NFTEarth NFTs, Earthlings dFNT, EarthFi, Earth Domains, and the NFTEarth DAO. Please note, as the NFTEarth project evolves, so has the method to inform current and potential Earthlings. Like many projects, we began with a single, fixed roadmap, having now moved towards a flexible and dynamic archive of information that the NFTEarth team can update in response to new developments and progress.

Why Layer2? Lower costs enable the potential for much greater web3 adoption.
{% endhint %}

The increasing number of applications and users on Ethereum are responsible for increasing the load on the network. The capacity of the Ethereum network is limited. Therefore, the cost of using the network increases prominently with more and more users competing with each other for adding transactions to the Ethereum network. So, Ethereum [layer2](https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/) scaling solutions are considered vital instruments for addressing the problems with network performance. Many solutions for Ethereum scaling are undergoing research, testing, and implementation with different approaches for achieving scalability.&#x20;
