NFTE Token Basics

NFTE is the native utility token of the NFTEarth ecosystem. It is designed primarily to be used for staking, voting, and boosting rewards.

NFTE is an ERC-20 token that incorporates LayerZero‚Äôs Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard. By leveraging this token architecture, the protocol has enabled a new era of interoperability across chains. Being natively Omnichain provides several large benefits for NFTEarth users and stakeholders - such as easy bridging of NFTE between chains while simultaneously leading to increased security compared to the more common bridging methods which are liquidity based.

**What is the token allocation for NFTEarth (NFTE)?**

The token distribution of NFTEarth (NFTE) is as follows:

* 10% is allocated to Liquidity
* 20% is allocated to Staking Rewards
* 8% is allocated to Airdrop 1
* 6% is allocated to Airdrop 2
* 6% is allocated to Airdrop 3
* 5% is allocated to Marketing
* 5% is allocated to NFTEarth DAO Treasury
* 5% is allocated to NFTEarth Team
* 20% is allocated to Advisors
* 15% is allocated to Reserve

**What is the total supply / circulating supply / global supply?**&#x20;

* 100,000,000 (100 Million) NFTE tokens. All tokens have been minted and are in circulation, spread across the networks the protocol has deployed the token to.

How can I confirm this information using a block explorer?

* Being that the NFTE token is an Omnichain token (OFT standard by LayerZero) - this can sometimes confuse data providers in web3, as the OFT standard is still a new and rapidly growing trend. Until it becomes the norm for protocols to issue Omnichain tokens, an easy way to view the supply of NFTE in real-time is to view the token supply on each block explorer (such as [Arbiscan](https://arbiscan.io/token/0x51b902f19a56f0c8e409a34a215ad2673edf3284) - Arbitrum's main block explorer) to see where the current supply of tokens is at. At any given moment in time, the supply will always total - when added together - to = precisely 100,000,000 across all chain deployments.&#x20;
* See below screenshot for an example: the largest amount of tokens are on Arbitrum in the screenshot below, accounting for \~74% of the token supply at the time of the image. This will fluctuate based on how users choose to move their tokens cross-chain via the NFTEarth Bridge (built into the UI) - or by users bridging their tokens via direct smart contract calls or using a block explorer directly.
