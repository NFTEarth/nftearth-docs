# üåè NFTE Token and Tokenomics

## NFTE Tokenomics <a href="#nfte-tokenomics" id="nfte-tokenomics"></a>

NFTE is the native utility token of the NFTEarth ecosystem. It is designed primarily to be used for staking, voting, and overall governance of the protocol. NFTE is an ERC-20 token that leverages the LayerZero Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) extension, which enables easy, fast, and secure bridging of NFTE cross-chain.
