# üåè NFTE Token and Tokenomics

## NFTE Token Basics

NFTE is the native utility token of the NFTEarth ecosystem. It is designed primarily to be used for staking, voting, and boosting.

NFTE is an ERC-20 token that incorporates LayerZero‚Äôs Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard. This using this architecture provides several large benefits for NFTEarth users and stakeholders - such as easy bridging of NFTE between chains and increased security compared to more common bridging methods (full OFT functionality is coming soon). NFTE is currently live on Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, and Binance Smart Chain.
