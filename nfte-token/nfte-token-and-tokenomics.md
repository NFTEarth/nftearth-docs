NFTE Token Basics

NFTE is the native utility token of the NFTEarth ecosystem. It is designed primarily to be used for staking, voting, and boosting rewards.

NFTE is an ERC-20 token that incorporates LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard. By leveraging this token architecture, the protocol has enabled a new era of interoperability across chains. Being natively Omnichain provides several large benefits for NFTEarth users and stakeholders - such as easy bridging of NFTE between chains while simultaneously leading to increased security compared to the more common bridging methods which are liquidity based.
