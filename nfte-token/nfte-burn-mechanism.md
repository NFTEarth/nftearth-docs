{% hint style="info" %}
When you stake NFTE LP tokens, it leaves your wallet and is staked in the NFTEarth staking contact. It will not be available to redeem until the end of the staking period you choose. The xNFTE you receive in return for your stake is non-transferable. Staking Rewards will be available in an upcoming UI release on NFTEarth.
