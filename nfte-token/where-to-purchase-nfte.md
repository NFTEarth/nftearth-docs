## NFTE Token Basics

NFTE is the native utility token of the NFTEarth ecosystem. It is designed primarily to be used for staking, voting, and boosting rewards. It is designed in a way that its value increases over time.

NFTE is an ERC-20 token that incorporates LayerZeroâ€™s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard for true cross-chain interoperability. By leveraging this innovative token architecture, the protocol has enabled a new era of interoperability across chains. Being natively Omnichain provides several large benefits for NFTEarth users and stakeholders - such as easy bridging of NFTE between chains and simultaneously leading to increased security when compared to the more common bridging methods, which are liquidity based. NFTE is currently live on Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Linea, Base, Mantle, and Ethereum.
