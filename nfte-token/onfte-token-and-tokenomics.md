# üåè ONFTE Token and Tokenomics

## ONFTE Token Basics

ONFTE is the native utility token of the NFTEarth ecosystem. It is designed primarily to be used for staking, voting, and boosting rewards.

ONFTE is an ERC-20 token that incorporates LayerZero‚Äôs Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard. By leveraging this token architecture, the protocol has enabled a new era of interoperability across chains. Being natively Omnichain provides several large benefits for NFTEarth users and stakeholders - such as easy bridging of ONFTE between chains while simultaneously leading to increased security compared to the more common bridging methods which are liquidity based. ONFTE is currently live on Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, and BNB Chain.
