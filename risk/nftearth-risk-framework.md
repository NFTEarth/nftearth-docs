  The composability, or lego blocks, of the DeFi ecosystem implies that risks
  from an individual component flow into all dependent systems. Liquidity is the

# üåè NFTEarth Risk Framework

This documentation presents a framework to assess vault and token risk for V1 of the NFTEarthFi Protocol. The risk methodology considers but is not limited to: market, counter-party, vault token protocols and smart contract risks for the tokens selected for the NFTEarthFi Protocoll, aiming to contribute to risk standards that are on par with traditional finance in terms of effectiveness, and even potentially more effective, when using AI and ML in modeling risk - to raise the overall standards across DeFi.
